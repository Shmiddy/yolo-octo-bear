Project Name: Bandwagn

Description: This service allows a user to create an account on the website bandwagn.me and receive emails containing information about bands that are coming close to the user and playing live shows.

On the website, users are able to link various online profiles such as their Spotify, Grooveshark, Last.fm, and other web music services in order to pick out bands that they like and then add those bands to the list of artists that the user is notified of.

(Tentative)

The user will also be able to manually add and remove artists from their profile to specify which shows they want to be notified about. The user can change various settings, such as the frequency of notifications, the locations that should be checked for proximity of live shows, and other basic settings like email, username, etc.
